**`ivDiag`** is toolkit for estimation and diagnostics with instrumental
variable (IV) designs. It provides `R` implementations of the guidelines
proposed in Lal et al.Â (2023), enabling researchers to obtain reliable
and robust estimates of their IV models.

**Examples:** `R` code used in the
[tutorial](https://yiqingxu.org/packages/ivDiag/articles/iv_tutorial.html)
can be downloaded from
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xuyiqing/ivDiag/main/pkgdown/ivDiag_examples.R).
